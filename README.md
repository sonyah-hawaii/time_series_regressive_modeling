### Executive Summary:  

This project aims to gain understanding of working with a small dataset with high variance. This dataset, comprised of 


- one leading performance metric
- one visual element
- if someone has two minutes to get the most important message from this, what would you write?
- mention some techniques
- Talk about what skills are demonstrated here that would be relevant to the job

### Target:
- Units of CO2 Abated (2014)  

### Attributes:
- Historical CO2 Abatement (1990-2013)
- Historical GDP Per Capita (1990-2013)
- Total CO2 Emissions (1990-2013)
- % of CO2 Emissions from Electricity and Heat (1990-2013)
